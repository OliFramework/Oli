# Oli Framework BETA 1.7.1

**Oli** is an *open source PHP framework* made to help web developers creating their website.

**Community is everything!**
Support me and suggest me anything!

### Start using it

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/releases/latest), extract Oli on your web server and configure your website!  
Need help setting it up? [Here's how to get started](https://github.com/OliFramework/Oli/wiki/Get-started).

Once configuration is done, start creating your pages in the "**content/theme/...**" directory.  
Put your stylesheets and scripts in "**content/theme/data/...**" directory for an easier access through Oli.
